Some matlab questions asked frequently in lab.. it's good for practice purpose...



Q1.	Find the response y(t) of a system with impulse response h(t) = u(t)-u(t-1)	to an input x(t)=u(t)-u(t-1)	Use convolution integral. Plot x(t),h(t)and y(t).

Q2.	For the above series RLC circuit find out i(t) if the initial conditions given are L=10 H , R=400 ohms and C=100μF with i(0)=4 Amp and i‟(0)= 15 amp/s.
(a)	vs (t) = delta(t)
(b)	vs (t) =u(t).



Q3. Frequency modulation or FM uses a wider bandwidth than amplitude modulation or AM but it is not affected as much as by noise as AM is. The output of an FM transmitter is of the form

 

y(t) cos(wt+2*pi*v*int(m(t))

Where m(t) is the message and frequency ν is in Hz/volt and the units of message are in volts.


post_1.	Create as the message a signal m(t)=cos (t). find the FM signal y(t) with ν=10 and then for ν=1. Let the carrier frequency 2π. Use MATLAB to generate different signals for times 0≤t≤10 at intervals Ts =0.01. Plot m(t) and the 2 FM signals for ν=10 and ν=1 in the same plot. Is the FM transmitter a linear system? Explain.


 
post_2.	Create a message signal

m1 (t)=1 when m(t)>=	0
 m1 (t)  =1 when m(t)<	0
 


Find the corresponding FM signal for ν=1
